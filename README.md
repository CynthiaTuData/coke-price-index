# Coke price index

Do you like Cokes? Are you team Coca-Cola or team Pepsi? I used to love drinking Coke, but since moving to the United States, I found that my love for this sweet, refreshing carbonated drink is decreasing. You see, I would constantly doing calculations whenever I'm buying small things. My brain would automatically convert what's on the price tag to the currency I use at home (CNY). When I stop at a vending machine, I'd start contemplating if I should fight my craving for my favorite soda for how much they cost here... Isn't it insane that a bottle of coke here in the United States costs 1.5 dollars? I can get five bottles of coke back home, even bigger sizes, with the same amount, as they usually cost 2 yuan (0.3 dollar) in China. 

So naturally, I complained to my mom about how everything is more expensive here in the States, which quickly escalated into an existential crisis: if I want to live in the U.S. after I graduate from grad school, if I can make enough money and survive off that once I leave school, whether I made the right choice going into journalism because we are paid so little... 

But my mom has her way of comforting me. "Once you start getting your paychecks, you'd stop complaining about soda prices. What you got paid for your part-time on-campus job  - is the equivalent of how much I get paid, after working for 30 years!"

And that's *global inequality* right there! Said the little voice in my head. 

Though my mom's consolation did not stop me from meticulously doing maths before picking up a drink from the shelf, I start wondering if the cost of these small things we enjoy in life, like a bottle of soda, could shine some light on the cost of living and the global economy.
